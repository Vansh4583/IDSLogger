# Intrusion Detection System Logger

## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a simple JavaScript script running on an Amazon EC2 instance. The system monitors access to a designated folder called 'TestFolder' and generates logs and notifications whenever the folder is accessed. The folder serves as a placeholder for an important folder within a Windows OS, and access to it simulates an indicator of compromise (IOC). This precautionary measure ensures the system's integrity and reliability
